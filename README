The script "crestore.vim" provide the command "Crestore". Before using a quickfix command the script
will save the current file and cursor position. Using "Crestore" will restore the file (and cursor position) used before.
 
Usage:

1. Run a quickfix command: vimgrep, make etc.
2. Jump around in the list, fix errors....
3. Type "Crestore" to go back to the file you used before. Quickfix window will be closed.
